A mod that adds a new whip called the Eel Slapper.

It can be caught in the ocean at any time. It is intended to be viable for the majority of pre-hardmode.

Eel Slapper stats:
Damage: 22
Velocity: 10
Use time: 30
Knockback: 4
Summon tag damage: 6
Multi-hit penalty: 33%

The Eel Slapper is based on a weapon from the original WeaponOut mod by Flashkirby99, but reworked and resprited from scratch to make it a 1.4 summon whip instead.
